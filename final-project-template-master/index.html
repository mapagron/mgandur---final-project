      <p>What are the ways which we can potentially interpret this data that are only possible through an interactive visualization?
      
      The perspective of the conflict beyond the guerrilla groups.
      
      So far, studies have focused on what the guerrilla groups have done as part of the Colombian conflict. However, crimes related to the violation of human rights, sexual assaults, and homicides have not been accounted for as a part of the consequences of said conflict.

      As part of the recent peace agreement between Colombiaâ€™s government and the guerrilla group FARC, the country faces new challenges which include building up different social structures and establishing mechanisms for the inclusion of guerrilla militants into the productive sector. As part of this data visualization, I would like to explore the special needs based on each region.</p>
      
      <hr>

      <p>The dataset includes more than 200,000 records of victims of homicides, sexual assaults, and battery during the period of 2010-2015. A row includes the date, the type and location of the felony, the gender, education level, and the age of the victim.</p>
